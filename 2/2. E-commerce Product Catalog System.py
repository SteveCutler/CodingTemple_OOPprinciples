# Objective: The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate a deep understanding of inheritance and 
# method overriding in Python. Students will apply these concepts to develop an E-commerce Product 
# Catalog System that handles various types of products with both common and unique attributes.

# Problem Statement: An e-commerce platform requires a system to manage different types of products, 
# such as books, electronics, and clothing. Each product type shares some common characteristics but 
# also has unique features. The system should be able to display information about each product appropriately.

# Task 1: Create Base Product Class

import productbase as PB

ball = PB.Product(1, "ball", 5.00)
ball.displayProduct()




#     Develop a base class Product with common attributes like product ID, name, price, and a method to 
# display product information.
#     Expected Outcome: A Product class that can hold general information about a product and display it.

# Task 2: Implement Subclasses for Specific Products

#     Create subclasses Book, Electronic, and Clothing that inherit from Product.
#     Each subclass should have additional attributes relevant to its category (e.g., author for books, specs
#      for electronics, size for clothing).
#     Expected Outcome: Each subclass contains both inherited attributes from Product and new attributes specific 
# to the product type.

import productbook as Pbook
import productelectronics as PE
import productclothing as PC

shirt = PC.Clothing(2,"shirt",10,"summer")

stereo = PE.Electronics(3,"stereo",50,"Audio")

warAndPeace = Pbook.Book(4,"War and Peace", 15, "Tolstoy")



# Task 3: Override Display Method in Subclasses

#     Override the method to display product information in each subclass to include specific attributes.
#     For example, the Book class should display the author, Electronic should display specs, etc.
#     Expected Outcome: Calling the display method on an instance of any subclass shows both common and specific 
# product details.

shirt.displayProduct()
stereo.displayProduct()
warAndPeace.displayProduct()

# Task 4: Test Product Catalog Functionality

#     Instantiate objects of each subclass and call their display methods to ensure correct information is shown.
#     Expected Outcome: The system should accurately display detailed information for each type of product, 
# demonstrating inheritance and method overriding.

# Code Examples:

# class Product:
#     # Constructor and common attributes
#     # ...

#     def display_info(self):
#         # General method to display product info
#         # ...

# class Book(Product):
#     def __init__(self, product_id, name, price, author):
#         super().__init__(product_id, name, price)
#         self.author = author

#     def display_info(self):
#         # Overridden method for books
#         # ...

# # Example usage
# my_book = Book("123", "Python Essentials", 29.99, "J. Doe")
# my_book.display_info()
